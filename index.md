Welcome to Double Double Stats and Trouble!

Wickets burn and innings bubble...

This is a living archive of cricket stats reports and analytical experiments.

As I build the Two Bats or Not To Bat database for studiyng, learning purposes and fun.

This is my way of registering some insights and numbers along the way.

For now itâ€™s all about sharing with the team and showcasing the numbers.
