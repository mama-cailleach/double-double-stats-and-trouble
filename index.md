Welcome to Double Double Stats and Trouble!
<br>*Wickets burn and innings bubble...*

This is a living archive of cricket stats reports and analytical experiments from **Two Bats or Not Two Bat**

As I build the TBONTB database for study, portfolio, and of course: fun. 

This site is my way of keeping a record of insights, oddities, and numbers I see along the way.

For now, itâ€™s all about sharing with the team and showcasing the numbers.
