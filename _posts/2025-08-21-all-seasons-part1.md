*No Results come from LMS that counted those matches as wins with an empty scorecard, so not to break my tables in the way I collected the data I decided to count those as no results, but not included on percentages rates.*

***Notes**: Assumes 1 extra = 1 ball for easier maths. Balls Faced comes from Batters Stats and Bowler Balls from Bowler Stats.* 
<br>*At a glance could mean our bowlers figures are pretty much accounted for (if done correctly during the match) except for 17 overs lost in the ether*
<br>*Residual gaps will be investigated further.*

## 🎳 Wicket Chronicles

### ☠️ **Wickets Taken: 752** 


| Dismissal | Count | % |
|-----------|-------|---|
| 🫴 Caught | 329 | 43.8% |
| 🥎 Bowled | 270 | 35.9% |
| 🏃 Run Out | 61 | 8.1% |
| 🧤 Stumped | 18 | 2.4% |
| 🦵 LBW | 38 | 5.1% |
| 🥸 Missing | 36 | 4.7% |



### 🪦 **Wickets Fallen: 1,015**


| Dismissal | Count | % |
|-----------|-------|---|
| 🫴 Caught | 414 | 40.8% |
| 🥎 Bowled | 444 | 43.7% |
| 🏃 Run Out | 81 | 8.0% |
| 🧤 Stumped | 25 | 2.5% |
| 🦵 LBW | 38 | 3.7% |
| 🥸 Missing | 13 | 1.3% |


<br><i>Missing are wickets that weren't registered in the batting scorecards so mode of dismissal is unknown, But are counted in the final match score. 
<br>This defo deserve it's own dive, I tried a quick investigation but then bowlers scorecards total also don't match, so is another hole to get sucked in...
<br>Not very shocking news, but is probably to do with the source. For example: Match 38 vs Elite Development Squad. 
<br>Final score says they were 199/2 in 20 overs, the 2 wickets are credited to our bowlers in bowling scorecard. But then their batting scorecard only have one Bowled in it, everyone else Not Out.</i>
