*Missing -1 in 2016 is amazing, so I went after it. Is from Match 48 vs Mixed Nuts*

*What happened is the wicket counted for the opposition instead*

*We only took 1 but their score is 218/2, we lost 5 but our score is 138/4*

*Also interesting on that match both extras are negative (insert mixed nuts pun)*

*For now I'm leaving as is because my tables are all done and is good trivia, deserve to be there*

*I'll update the main data later on when I gather more info on other inconsistencies too*
